**Key Optimizations:**
1. **Incremental strategy** based on `created_at` timestamp
2. **Partition by day** on `created_at` for efficient querying
3. **Clustering** on `customer_id` and `created_at` for better query performance
4. **Eliminated correlated subquery** - replaced with efficient LEFT JOIN
5. **Added column selection** in customers CTE to reduce data scanning
6. **Unique key** set to `order_id` for proper incremental updates
